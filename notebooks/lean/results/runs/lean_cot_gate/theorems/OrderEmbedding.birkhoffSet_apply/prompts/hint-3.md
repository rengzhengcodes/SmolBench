`rfl : a = a` is the unique constructor of the equality type. This is the
same as `Eq.refl` except that it takes `a` implicitly instead of explicitly.

This is a more powerful theorem than it may appear at first, because although
the statement of the theorem is `a = a`, Lean will allow anything that is
definitionally equal to that type. So, for instance, `2 + 2 = 4` is proven in
Lean by `rfl`, because both sides are the same up to definitional equality.

### `Eq` (commanddeclaration) at `.lake/packages/lean4/src/lean/Init/Prelude.lean`
```lean
/--
The equality relation. It has one introduction rule, `Eq.refl`.
We use `a = b` as notation for `Eq a b`.
A fundamental property of equality is that it is an equivalence relation.
```
variable (α : Type) (a b c d : α)
variable (hab : a = b) (hcb : c = b) (hcd : c = d)

example : a = d :=
  Eq.trans (Eq.trans hab (Eq.symm hcb)) hcd
```
Equality is much more than an equivalence relation, however. It has the important property that every assertion
respects the equivalence, in the sense that we can substitute equal expressions without changing the truth value.
That is, given `h1 : a = b` and `h2 : p a`, we can construct a proof for `p b` using substitution: `Eq.subst h1 h2`.
Example:
```
example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
        (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  Eq.subst h1 h2

example (α : Type) (a b : α) (p : α → Prop)
    (h1 : a = b) (h2 : p a) : p b :=
  h1 ▸ h2
```
The triangle in the second presentation is a macro built on top of `Eq.subst` and `Eq.symm`, and you can enter it by typing `\t`.
